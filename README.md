# Food-Claims-Analysis-With-PowerBI
I worked on this project to ace my Data Analyst Associate [Certification](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DAA0010430084846) with DataCamp. 

The analysis was for "Vivendo" a fictitious fast food chain in Brazil with over 200 outlets.

According to the project description, customers often claim compensation from the company for food poisoning and their legal team processes these claims. The legal team has offices in four locations.

The legal team wants to improve how long it takes to reply to customers and close claims. The head of the legal department wants a report on how each location differs in the time it
takes to close claims.
