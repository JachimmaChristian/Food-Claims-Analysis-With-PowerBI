There are no missing values. No changes were made to this column.\n\n**time_to_close:** The values of this column ranged from 76 to 518 and match the description given. There were no missing values. No changes were made to this column.\n\n**claim_amount:** The values of this column were all rounded to 2 decimal places and ranged from 1637.94 to 76106.80. There were no missing values,however the 'R$' Brazilian currency logo was removed, and the data type converted from text to decimal number to make the values match the description given. \n\n**amount_paid:** The values of this column were all rounded to 2 decimal places ranged from 1516.72 to 52498.75. There were 36 (NA) missing values. The missing values were replaced with the median value of the remaining data, which was 20105.70 and the data type converted from text to decimal number to match the description given.\n\n**location:** This column had four unique categories,'RECIFE', 'FORTALEZA', 'SAO LUIS', 'NATAL', that match the description given. There were no missing values. No changes were made to this column.\n\n**individual_on_claim:** The values of this column range from 1 to 15, and match those in the description. There were no missing values hence no changes were made to this column.\n\n**linked_cases:** The values in this column were either TRUE or FALSE that match the description given. There were 26 (NA) missing values. All missing values were replaced with FALSE.\n\n**Cause:** This column had three unique categories,'vegetable','meat' and 'unknown' that match those in the description. But had two additional categories that didn't match the description, 'Meat' and 'VEGETABLES', both were renamed to match the description.","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 2\n\nCreate a visualization that shows the number of claims in each location.

The legal team should focus on Recife as they are the location with the most observations.","metadata":{},"id":"1d5ba38c-1b3a-4f9b-bf38-bb0a62dac346","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 3\n\nDescribe the distribution of time to close for all claims.

This means that there are a few claims that took a very long time to close, while the majority of claims took a shorter amount of time to close.\n\nThe histogram shows that the most common time to close a claim is 76-86 days. There are also a significant number of claims that took 87-96 days to close. However, there are a few claims that took much longer to close, with the longest claims taking over 300 days to close. \n\nThe outliers in the distribution of time to close indicates rare instances of claims taking over 300 days to close. These claims may have been more complex or involved more people. However, it is also possible that there were delays in the claims process that could have been avoided. The team should consider investigating further into these.","metadata":{},"id":"8fcff247-db49-42c0-8710-51848aeb6347","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 4\n\nDescribe the relationship between time to close and location.

From the graph above, the relationship between time_to_close and location is a positive relationship because as the claims in each location increases the time_to_close increases. \n\nThe area chart shows that the claims that took the longest time to close are in Recife, with 44.25% of the grand total, this is followed by Sao Luís at 25.85%, Fortaleza, with 15.55%, and Natal, with 14.35%.\n\nBased on these, I'll recommend that the legal team should increase the number of staff in Recife as this would help to reduce the backlog of claims and speed up the process of closing claims and also provide more training to staff in Recife on how to handle complex claims this would help to ensure that claims are processed more efficiently and effectively. \n\nMost importantly I will recommend for further research to be done, to analyze the data for other factors that may be affecting the time to close claims such as claim amount and individuals on claim.impact of population of a location on time_to_close.","metadata":{},"id":"170dd2ea-340f-4ab4-94c8-fe077342e98e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## ✅ When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
